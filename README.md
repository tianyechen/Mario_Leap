## Configure Leap Motion Files:

Cd into leap_files
Open gesture1.py and on line 10, change the path path to your lib/x64 folder inside the SDK you downloaded:

```
Open gesture2.py and repeat the same steps

Pip install the following python packages (latest version):

## Running the game (you will need to open three terminals A, B, C):
In terminal A start the leapmotion daemon (in ubuntu you have to manually start it)
```
$ leapd
```

In terminal B start the python main script
```
$ python main.py
```
Follow the prompts and chose which mode youâ€™d like to play the game in

In terminal C start the mario game
```
$ ./uMario
```

Hit enter twice to start the game on the first level and you should be all set to play the game using the chosen modality!
